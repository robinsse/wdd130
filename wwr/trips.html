            <h2>Snake South Fork</h2>
            <img src="images/small-rafting1.webp" alt="Snake South Fork">
            <p>Today’s white water rafting trip on the South Fork of the Snake River was nothing short of exhilarating.
                From the moment we pushed off into the icy current, the adrenaline started flowing. The sun was high,
                and the air crisp, with the towering canyon walls casting shadows over the river. We paddled hard
                through Class III and IV rapids, each one jostling the raft and soaking us in glacial runoff. The river
                twisted and surged, its currents unpredictable and thrilling. Bald eagles soared above us, watching
                silently from pine trees clinging to the cliffs. Between rapids, there were moments of calm—serene pools
                where the world felt still and ancient. But they never lasted long. With a shout from our guide, we’d
                launch into the next turbulent stretch, paddles slapping water, hearts pounding, laughter mixing with
                the roar of the river. We all came out soaked, exhausted, and totally alive.</p>
            <p>Later, as we dried out on the banks near the take-out, the group swapped stories of near-tips and perfect
                maneuvers. The South Fork had tested us, no doubt, but it also gave us something incredible: the rush of
                nature’s raw power and the joy of shared adventure.</p>

            <h2>Hells Canyon</h2>
            <img src="images/small-rafting2.webp" alt="Snake South Fork">
            <p>Rafting through Hells Canyon today felt like stepping into a different world—wild, remote, and humbling.
                As the deepest river gorge in North America, the cliffs rose around us like ancient guardians, their
                sheer walls glowing gold in the morning light. The Snake River surged beneath us, powerful and moody,
                throwing up waves that towered over our raft. We tackled rapids like Wild Sheep and Granite with grit
                and wide-eyed excitement, clinging to every command from our guide. The water was a frothy blur, our
                paddles moving in rhythm, spray blinding us as we shouted and whooped through the chaos. In quieter
                moments, we drifted past basalt formations and hidden beaches, the silence broken only by the cry of
                ospreys and the murmur of water against stone. The canyon seemed to swallow all sound, wrapping us in
                its immense presence. Each bend in the river revealed something new, some stretch even more beautiful
                than the last.</p>
            <p>By the time we reached camp, the sun was dipping behind the ridges, and the river turned to molten
                silver. We warmed our hands by the fire and relived every wild moment, still buzzing from the day’s
                rush. Hells Canyon had shown us both fury and calm, and it left a mark on all of us.</p>

            <h2>Salmon River</h2>
            <img src="images/small-rafting3.webp" alt="Snake South Fork">
            <p>The Salmon River, often called the "River of No Return," lived up to its legendary name today. From the
                moment we launched, the landscape felt untouched—towering pines, rugged cliffs, and water so clear you
                could see the rocks ten feet below. Our raft danced across choppy rapids like Rainier and Black Creek,
                each one challenging but deeply rewarding. The rhythm of paddling became meditative, broken only by
                bursts of laughter or sudden jolts as we slammed through standing waves. Golden eagles circled above us,
                and mule deer watched from the banks as we passed by. The river twisted through a maze of boulders and
                narrow canyons, a wild corridor carved by time. The silence between rapids felt sacred, like we were
                guests in a place much older and wiser than us. It was one of those days where you forgot everything
                else—just the raft, the river, and the pulse of the current pulling you forward.</p>
            <p>As the sun started to fade behind the hills, we set up camp on a sandy beach, the air cooling quickly
                under the shadow of the canyon walls. Dinner never tasted so good, and stories flowed as freely as the
                river beside us. The Salmon had tested our nerve, soaked us to the bone, and left us grinning ear to
                ear. It’s the kind of river that lingers in your memory, not just for the thrills, but for the way it
                makes you feel small—in the best possible way.</p>
